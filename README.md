# React boilerplate with webpack 5

- Same folder structure with public as a **CRA** but simplified bundle and lighter build
- development and production setups ready for a production release
- Without vulnerabilities (so far)
- Configured for alias (already `@components` implemented)
- SplitChunk optimization for spliting libraries bundles (react and reactDom so far, but you can add them into the regex)
- Possibility to proxy your servers endpoints (example in webpack dev config)
- start it with `npm install` then `npm start`
